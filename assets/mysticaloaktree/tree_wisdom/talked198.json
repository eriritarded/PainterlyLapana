    "I once knew a white rabbit called Toast.",
    "He was loved by all animals even the most by the coast.",
    "One day he did the horrible deed of eating the carrots from Farmer Larry's field.",
    "Larry was a bold one with a skin of ash and an eye of blue.",
    "Toast fled away but striken by spell not seen by many again.",
    "Now many rabbits still bear his curse."
