Painterly Continuation Pack - Base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by rhodox & friends (& fans)

NOTE: This text is largely taken from the original Painterly Pack readme, with a few edits.

This pack is meant to serve as a base for a customized Painterly Pack. You can customize it using the zip of all the Painterly assets from the old website, which is also available on our Discord server.

Unless noted otherwise, all graphics in this pack were edited and created by Rhodox. A few textures were generously provided by various individuals and are included in the pack with permission. These individuals were credited under their individual contributions on the web site (www.painterlypack.net) or on the Painterly Continuation Project discord server. The default paintings are NES sprites, and so belong to whoever made those games, I suppose.

Splash texts are a mix of original contributions, fun phrases collected from the Painterly Pack customizer as preserved at archive.org, and some are quotes from the Painterly Pack Telethon from back in 2011.

This pack may be used freely in whole or in part by any owner of Minecraft, and combined with other texture packs, so long as credit is given and no profit or donations are solicited through that person's use of the textures and skins contained within. You don't have to credit anyone if you use it with your youtube videos or promoting your server or things of that nature, but it's appreciated if you do.

Thank you to Rhodox for creating the original Painterly Pack, and of course, a thank you to Mojang for creating such a terribly addictive, endlessly entertaining game!
